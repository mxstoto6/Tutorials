Be careful though, the playable ROMs **depend on the calculator model**, and the techniques too.

This tutorial only concerns Casio `Graph 35 + E` / `Graph 35 + USB` / `Graph 90 + E`.

For other models, or **TexasInstruments** calculators, please refer to https://bit.ly/3zKjEWv.

With that, let's start the tutorial:


- Download the folder containing the necessary files: **[Files.zip] (https://github.com/mxstoto6/Tutorials/files/7110138/Files.zip)**.
- Extract it on your desk, or elsewhere.

- Connect the calculator with the supplied USB cable.
- On the PC, access the file explorer, and open the calculator, then recognized as a USB disk.
- Place the files that I made you download at the **root** of the calculator (those contained in `Files`).

- Disconnect the calculator, and on the latter, access the emulator, `prizoop`.
- Here, select the game you want, and launch it via `F6` +` exe`.

I have provided you with some games, but if you want yours here is how to do it:

- Go to a ROM download site (find it yourself).
- Then go to https://bit.ly/38IqLTi. You will be able to convert your ROMs for the calculator there (the creation of an account is unfortunately required).

- Then as above, place your games at the root of the calculator, accompanied by the emulator (`prizoop`).
